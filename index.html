<h2 calss="title">Hi!</h2>
<p>Cool that you found my page here on qrz.com!</p>
<p>You can find me on our local repeater <a target="_blank" href="https://automatic.sral.fi/index.php?st=260">OH9RAB</a> if the magic smoke has not come out from my rig. If it has come out, in that case you can find me on 20m using FT8</p>
<br />
<p>Currently, I'm working on building an off-grid chat application called "LoRa Chat" just for fun. It uses LoRa radio modules to create a decentralized mesh network where users can chat and transfer small amounts of data (sensor, offset/"wiki" etc.). If you are interested in checking it out, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/komppa/LoRaChat_v4" target="_blank">https://github.com/komppa/LoRaChat_v4</a></p>
<p>To make it easy to update the bootloader, partition table, firmware itself, and the web-based user interface for the ESP32, I created the LoRaChat Device Firmware Update application that uses WebUSB. This allows updating end nodes easily without the need to install SDKs and other software. Only web browser and one USB cable is required. You can check out that project <a href="https://github.com/komppa/LoRaChat_DFU" target="_blank">here</a>. It can also be accessed from the hosted site <a href="https://firmware.rantakangas.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Check out my website and projects on GitHub!</p>
